# Matplotlib and pyplot

## Introduction 

This GitHub repository contains code and visualizations related to character frequency distribution and data plotting using Python's matplotlib library.

## Description

The repository includes three code snippets that demonstrate different aspects of data visualization and analysis. Each snippet is described below:

1. Character Frequency Distribution - The first code (Question 1) snippet calculates the frequency distribution of characters in a given text string and visualizes it using a bar plot. 
2. Scatter and Plot Visualization - The second code (Question 2 & 3 ) snippet generates a sequence of random numbers and visualizes the data using both scatter and plot graphs on separate axes. 
3. Sorting Algorithm Execution Time - The final code (Question 4) snippet demonstrates how to plot the execution time of two sorting algorithms, insertion sort and merge sort, based on the size of the input list. 

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)

Each question is worth two points: 


* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)
